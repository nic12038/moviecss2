<p>
	Tucker and Dale VS Evil is a comedy horror film. It pokes fun at all of the 80's horror films where teenagers would go out to the woods on a trip and someting would go terribley wrong. This time however everything that this is going wrong and killing the teenagers is a complelte accident! The teenagers are first scared off by some awkward, but harmless rednecks who live out in the woods. Then the teenagers keep getting scared and accidently dying by random things in the woods. Like wood chippers and sharp branches. It is a masterpiece and I hope they make a second one.
